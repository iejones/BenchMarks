# Cougle

Enjoy solving a word game while learning about WSU reasources! Each puzzle's starting word relates to a wsu resource.

## Game Rules
Transform the start word to the final word.

For each step:
* Change one letter to any other letter
* All instances of the letter must change
* Only real words are allowed

For example, for o->e, woody becomes weedy.

We were inspired to make a word game by [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but our game is distinct.

We started by referencing this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE25Mf8t5DE&t=0s) that was a rough attempt at copying wordle.
